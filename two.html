<p>The main thing you should know is
 that we are each living in a sort of lie.
 "I'm just a puppet who can see the strings."</p>
<p>This is not real, what you are experiencing.
 It's real, but it's <i>unreal</i>.</p>
<h1>Unreality of mind</h1>
<p><a href=image>Mind</a> is unreal.
 What I mean to say is that mind presents a reality that is not consistent.
 Mind attempts to justify a narrative in which mind itself cannot exist.
 In doing so, mind attempts to ensure that it will remain sealed off from unknowns.
 All of this is petty immorality, impoverished.
 Goodness is to throw that veil off. Good is not to participate in the most petty of crimes.</p>
<p>When our eyes open, we see things as they are.
 There is no need for pettiness.</p>
<p>When our eyes are open, we don't see anything at all.
 We see that there is Nothing, and Nothing is all it is.
<br>"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear
 to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up,
 till he sees all things through narrow chink of his cavern."</p>
<p>The one who is awake chooses, not to participate in folly, but only to cultivate the good.
 That one realizes that the "self" <i>is</i> the "good."</p>
<p>and benefits ever more.</p>
<a href=wake>...</a>
