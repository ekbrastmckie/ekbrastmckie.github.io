<h1>REALITY!</h1>
<br>
<h2>Mind and the Real</h2>
<p>I once wrote that "Reality is Illusion."
 In fact, this is not the case.
 Mind is illusion.
<br>[Mind <a href=true>is</a> of the Real. Belief in Mind is delusion.]</p>
<p>Mind is a beautifully illustrated pornographic videogame.</p>
<p>Mind is merely a simulacrum of a miniscule portion of the Real.</p>
<p>Mind is all we know.
 Therefore it appears most real to our unwitting eyes.
 In fact, Mind is real.
 Do not mistake my meaning.
 Mind exists in the Real.
 It truly does exist.</p>
<p>It is only our foolish discernment, the discernment of Mind itself,
 which imagines that any sun <i>we see</i> is the Real Sun.
 Make no mistake, that discernment is false.</p>
<p>A sun I see is just that, a <a href=image><i>sun I see</i></a>.
 It is nothing more nor anything less.
 The Real Sun is elsewhere.
 It is outside of Mind.</p>
<br>
<h2>Mind</h2>
<p>Mind is a structure evolved by natural selection,
 populated with memories, and patterned with chains of behavior.</p>
