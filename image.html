<h1>What is Mind?</h1>
<p>Mind is all that we know. It is composed of images;
 these are not images of the ordinary sort,
 which one finds in picture-books and museums and the like.</p>
<p>Rather, they are more like stories, or memories.
 The Image is the <i>type</i> of which Carl Jung has described his <i>archetypes</i>.
<br> Plainly put, they are mental images, maps, and narratives.
 They are what we experience.
 We should pray that they are in fact images of the Real.
Jung's archetypes are his proposed categeories of Image based upon his observations of myths and dreams.</p>
<h2>What are Images?</h2>
<p>Images are Real.
 I refer to them as Images because they portray the Real;
 Though they are Real in themselves,
 they are distinct from that which they portray
 and must be recognized as so.</p>
<p>It is so easy to believe that an Image
 and that which it portrays are identical!
<br> Do not believe that this is so.
<br> An Image is <b>always</b> discrete from its object of portrait.</p>
