<p>waking, sleeping</p>
<p>sleeping, waking</p>
<p>asleep, I am awake</p>
<p>awake, I am awake</p>
<p>waking, I am awake</p>
<p>sleeping, I wake.</p>
<h1>SLEEP</h1>
<p>Sleep. A human universal, no?
 Perhaps. Sleep. When we sleep, if we do not dream,
 then it seems that we wake as soon as we drift off.
 Awake, time seems to move by at a speed.
 Sleeping, time seems to slip away instantly.
<br>Really, then, isn't sleep just a function of waking?
 A way of making time progress. Not that <i>only</i>, of course.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, to think of sleeping and waking as two discrete entities would be foolishness.
 The sleeper is merely the waker having slept. Likewise, the waker is the woken sleeper.
 What are we to make of this?</p>
<h1>The one</h1>
<p>The one is what you are. It'a not a He. It's not a who. It is.</p>
<p>Knowing this, you know <a href=story>all there is to know</a>.
 Don't concern yourself with anything beyond this assertion.
 If you're lucky, you improved your vocabulary today.
 If you're really lucky, you may have permanently altered your understanding of yourself.
 Congratulations to those few lucky winners.</p>
<p>Forget everything, and remember...</p>
