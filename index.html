<h1>THE IMMORTAL DAY</h1>
<p>UNENDING, as its life runs short and inevitably becomes nothing, it remains. As unchangingly radiant as the sun, it persists.</p>
<p>Life is nothing to the truly faithful. The day is eternal.</p>
<p>Welcome to this website. Here I will investigate the nature of mind in poetry. I invite you to read at your leisure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The light shines backward into my eyes</p>
<p>The mind radiates backward into my past</p>
<p>Everything in it is illusory; though it appears to be present it is not.</p>
<p>The light is present.</p>
<p>It is the light of existence, which shines in the abyss.</p>
