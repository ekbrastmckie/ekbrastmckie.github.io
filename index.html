<h1>THE IMMORTAL DAY</h1>
<p>UNENDING, as its life runs short and inevitably becomes nothing, it remains. As unchangingly radiant as the sun, it persists.</p>
<p>Life is nothing to the truly faithful. The day is eternal.</p>
<p>Welcome to this website. Here I will investigate the nature of mind in poetry. I invite you to read at your leisure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The light shines backward from my eyes</p>
<p>My mind shines backward into the past</p>
<p>Everything in it is illusory; though it appears to be present, it is not.</p>
<p>The light is present.</p>
<p>It is the light of existence, which shines in the abyss.</p>

<p>Mind</p>
<p>Mind is all that you perceive.</p>
<p>You are not mind.</p>
<p>Mind is everywhere you look.</p>
<p>It is everything you touch.</p>
<p>You are the witness, within the garden of mind</p>
<p>Mind beckons you, and you heed</p>
<p>Yet when the voice of your father calls,</p>
<p>you heed not!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moments pass by, and I recall my nature. Realizing that I am limited, I abandon all hope...</p>
<p>I am the witness. I am within the garden.</p>
<p>I am executor of will.</p>
<p>Will is my power. I wield instruments worthy of a god.</p>
<p>The mind, electromagnetic artifice of nature, living consciousness</p>
<p>the horns of a snail,</p>
<p>the body itself is its vessel, is its artificer.</p>
<p>Mind is a body of electromagnetic organs</p>
<p>functioning as a tool with which I manipulate reality</p>
<p>The holy ghost</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mind is real</p>
<p>I am real</p>
<p>Mind is vast and complex</p>
<p>Mind is me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In mind, there is perception, and there is motion.</p>
<p>We practice awareness exercise to unite them</p>
<p>We may live in their chaotic entanglement</p>
<p>The broadest jungle, home to all manner of beasts</p>
<p>The Jungle of Immortal Day</p>
