Watch yourself.
<br>This is the best thing you can do for any person.
 Watch that person. Do this for yourself!
 Be there and see what's going on.
 You don't need to be all metaphysical, you don't need magickal energy or qi.
 You can look at yourself the way you look at anyone or anything.
 Just see what's there. Witness the form, or the feeling, or idea.
<br>This is meditation. It is called zen, or dhyana, awareness.
</p>
<p>
You are beautiful. Your body is alive.
 You are that body. Stand up, drop everything, and feel that body.
 Notice that. That is real.
 Thought and emotion can play in you without any real consequence.
 Your body is for real. Your body is the stage, the playing field,
 your whole world.
 Be there!
<br>Science tells us that the world is made of particles and chunks of particles.
 I'm telling you that you are made out of soul!
</p>
<p>
Do you know what you need to do?
 Right now, I'm gonna tell you what I need to do.
 I need to move this body.
 I need to practice awareness.
 I need to speak the truth where people can hear it.
 This place, any time. Very much love to all of you, human beings, beloved, soul children of the good.
