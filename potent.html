Start to understand humans as we really are.
 We have potential. I'm into the origins of words,
 I'll tell you, related words are
<br>
Potent!
<br>
Possible
<br>
Â¡Poder!
</p><p>
The point is potential. You can do a lot of things,
 become many different things. What you become depends on a lot of things, too.
 A lot of things are possible.
<br>
They say that knowledge is power, and that's really true.
 It means that understanding, knowledge of reality, is power.
 When you know how the whole world works,
 you know how your choices will affect the world.
 Then you can choose which possibility to make real.
<br>
When you understand yourself,
 you will know how your choices will affect you.
 You can then choose what you will become.
</p><p>
This stuff is real.
 You can read about this in the Scientific American
 and in the most ancient religious texts.
<br>
Meditation won't make you a good person.
 If you want to be a good person, do good things.
 If you want to meditate, do that.
 This is the key! This is what Shia LaBeouf was shouting about.
 You want to? Do it. You can.
 I am giving you permission right now, and if someone tells you you can't do that,
 tell them that I said, you can.
</p><p>
This is wrapped up with good and bad.
 If you have power, you need to do good things, right?
 What is the right thing to do?
<br>
Human beings are for helping human beings.
 Humans are made for love.
 That's another thing that you can hear in the science podcast
 and the ancient spiritual tradition.
 I've thought at times that I was a monster, a parasite, and a hideous deformity.
 I've thought that I was evil. I've thought that I deserved to die.
 The truth is that I am a human.
 The real parasite is the corporate machine feeding on the Earth
 and that machine has been created by ordinary people.
 It's fed by people who don't know what to do but to feed it, and
 its mind is made up of people who don't know the harm it causes.
 This is why I need to speak out. I do it for every person who will know that there is another possibility.
<br>
Humans are made for love.
 Love is what makes us kind.
 Love is what makes us helpful.
 Love is what makes us beautiful.
 Love is what makes us good.
 All we need do is remember that truth.
 When we return to that love,
 then we will be able to become better still.
 We can be good to animals, to plants, and to the Earth.
 First, we need to be good to ourselves.
