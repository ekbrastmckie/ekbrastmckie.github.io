<h1>A POEM<h2>
<br>
<pre>
Ah.....


I wake up to the sound of the cars, every morning
Drug infused poisoners stumble to and fro
 in a most festive manner, I might add


It's all here,
in the city
Come get rich
in the city
Have no fear
in the city
Stay here
in the city

*high-kicking dancers and tophats abound*


At the train station,
there was a man selling books.
I stopped and spoke with him.

Outside, there is a bright sky.
It's too bright! What ever happened to
the Night??

Remind me, once more, of
what I came here for
Won't you tell me again? Won't you
tell me just one more time?
Don't remember, just forget
Spend your money into debt
Don't care what you're waiting for
Spare me when I beg for more
Bare my body on the floor.
