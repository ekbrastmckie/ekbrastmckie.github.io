<h1>THE SUN!</h1>
<p>The Sun! Magnificent source of light and heat! You are like the sun, sweet child.</p>
<p>The Sun! Brilliant radiance</p>
<p>The eye is the image of the sun, focused center and diffuse attention on all sides.</p>
<p>The Sun is like the philosopher's stone. Unmoving, it moves; it is complete; it is filled with energy, dense, yet remains intact. It submits to gravity, while its vast power expresses massively</p>
<p>The Sun is fire! Its power explodes continually, orgasmic! It heeds no law but EXPRESS!</p>
<p>It knows no bound but mortality.</p>
<br>
<h1><a href=real>Philosopher's Stone</a></h1>
<p>Where is the philosopher's stone? Earth with Heaven united</p>
<p>Where is it to be found?</p>
<p>What is the philosopher's stone? The truth</p>
<br>
<p>The real / The genuine, <a href=really>authentic</a></p>
<p>In and out, whole-object, solidity in perfect animation, soulful</p>
<p>engagement in itself, physical revealed to be the metaphysical</p>
<p>God</p>
<p>It is life</p>
<p>It is everything</p>

<h1>Sun and Earth</h1>
<p>One day, Sun was out walking when he saw Earth come out from the bush.
 Earth said, "Sun, it's time you paid for all the burns I've gotten.
 Before Sun could do a thing, Earth picked him up and chucked him, way out over the sea.</p>
<p>Sun knew if he fell in the sea, he's drown and that was the end.
 Just then, he saw Crow flying over the beach.
 "Crow," Sun screamed, "save me from drowning in the sea, please!"
 Crow heard Sun calling, and he flew out over the waves and caught Sun in his beak.</p>
<p>Sun was so hot that crow's feathers turned black and his voice got hoarse from holding Sun in his mouth.
 Soon Crow landed on the beach and dropped Sun on the ground. Crow hopped away, coughing.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Crow," Sun exclaimed. "Without you I surely would have perished.
 For your trouble, I gift you the power of <i>knowledge</i>.
 You will rise above your peers and wield great power."</p>
<p>"Thank you, O Sun," says Crow, and flies away.</p>
<p>Soon Crow spies Earth bathing in the stream, so he lands on a stone. "Hello, Mother," says Crow.</p>
<p>Earth turns, and she sees Sun's <i>knowledge</i> inside Crow's eye.
 "Crow, where did you find that power in your eye?" she says.</p>
<p>Crow says, "Sun gave it to me."</p>
<p>Earth sees his black feathers and hears his hoarse voice and she says, "Crow, how did your feathers get so black and your voice so hoarse?"</p>
<p>Crow says "My voice and my feathers got this way when I caught Sun in my beak."</p>
<p>Now Earth is suspicious. She says, "Crow, why did you catch Sun in your beak?"</p>
<p>Crow says, "Because, mother, he begged me to save him from drowning in the sea."</p>
<p>Earth grabs Crow, and she says, "Crow, you went against my will so I'm gonna hurt you.
 From now on, all the other birds will hate you. You will have no peace, and always have to work for your supper. And, I will not protect you any longer.
 To me, you are nothing. Now go, and bathe in your misery."</p>
<p>So saying, she snapped her fingers and it was so. Crow flew away in shame and despair.</p>
<p>That's how Crow got his feathers, and why he's so smart. Crow <i>knows</i> things people don't know.</p>
<br>
<p>The End.</p>
