<h1>THE SUN!</h1>
<p>The Sun! Magnificent source of light and heat! You are like the sun, sweet child.</p>
<p>The Sun! Brilliant radiance</p>
<p>The eye is the image of the sun, focused center and diffuse attention on all sides.</p>
<p>The Sun is like the philosopher's stone. Unmoving, it moves; it is complete; it is filled with energy, dense, yet remains intact. It submits to gravity, while its vast power expresses massively</p>
<p>The Sun is fire! Its power explodes continually, orgasmic! It heeds no law but EXPRESS!</p>
<p>It knows no bound but mortality.</p>
<br>
<h1>Philosopher's Stone</h1>
<p>Where is the philosopher's stone? Earth with Heaven united</p>
<p>Where is it to be found?</p>
<p>What is the philosopher's stone? The truth</p>
<br>
<p>The real / The genuine, authentic</p>
<p>In and out, whole-object, solidity in perfect animation, soulful</p>
<p>engagement in itself, physical revealed to be the metaphysical</p>
<p>God</p>
<p>It is life</p>
<p>It is everything</p>
