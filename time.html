<h2>The Text</h2>
<p>1 The light shines backward from my eyes</p>
<p>2 My mind shines backward into the past</p>
<p>3 Everything in it is illusory;
 though it appears to be present, it is not.</p>
<p>4 The light is present.</p>
<p>5 It is the light of existence,
 which shines in the abyss.</p>
<br>
<p>1. The Light(4, 5) may be taken literally,
 as electromagnetic radiation,
 or as symbolic of <a href=real>the Real</a> as a whole.
<br>The Light merely <i>appears</i> to "shine[] backward from [the] eyes."
 See point 2. On further reflection,
 I have come to believe that this line is perhaps nothing more than poetic edifice.</p>
<p>2. Mind forever dwells on memory.
 Even a direct experience can only come so close to the present [keep reading].
 Light takes time to reach the eye.
 Mind takes time to create an <a href=image>image</a>.
<br>The one thing we experience in real time is <a href=real>Mind</a>.
 Mind is our only experience and it is present.
 If Mind could be purified, freed from abstraction,
<br>perhaps suffering would slough off.</p>
<p>3. Actually, Mind is present.
 Only, it is not what it appears to be,
 which is external and Real.
 Mind is an <a href=image>image</a> of the Real,
 produced by some particular processes.</p>
<p>4. All that is Real is present. The light is Real. The Mind is Real.
 The Mind is not the light.
 The Mind only appears to be the light.</p>
<p>5. </p>
