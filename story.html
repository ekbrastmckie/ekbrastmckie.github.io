<p>"'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
<br>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
<br>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
<br>He chortled in his joy."</p>
<p class="tab">Lewis Carroll, <i>Jabberwocky</i>.</p>

<h1>What's not to Like?</h1>
<p>In this wonderful, terrifying, mysterious world,
 we have only our will to protect us from the machinations of cruel Reality.
 Beware all those who speak of faith in the External. They are slaves.
<br>In this world, we can only trust in what is trusted, trustworthy.
 Tentatively we must test each stone, that it might not slip from beneath our step.
 I preach faith in faith, faith in experience. This is the true faith, faith in truth.
 Keep not faith in lies.</p>
