<p>First, the Real.</p>
<p>No. Before the first comes the Legend,
 the Key to this Map. It is as follows:
<br>In the forthcoming textual Map,
<br>Capitalized Words indicate Objects presumed to be of the Real
<br></p>
<h1>THE MAP</h1>
<p>first, the Real.
<br>It is all that is. It is everything, the one thing.</p>
<p>now we'll jump right in. Mind is <i>of the Real</i>,
 this quality henceforth being referred to as <i>real</i>.</p>
<p>recap: the Real is real. Mind is real.</p>
<p>next up is <a href=body>Body</a>.
 Body is that of which Mind <i>may</i> be aware.</p>
<p>okay. next: Mind is not identical to the Real.
<br>there is <i>something</i> real which is not Mind.
<br>It is the Unknown. or the Darkness. or Chaos, the Incomprehensible.</p>
<p>let's review. we have Mind and the Unknown on a level, the two components of the Real.
<br>then there's Body. Body is more a theoretical construct than anything else.
 It is defined only by the fact that all of Mind is contained within It.
 as the same is true of the Real, and, additionally, both possess an unknown element,
<br>"Body" is no different from the Real, <i>as far as each has been defined</i>.</p>
<p>so, our map consists of three labels,
<br>Real: comprising the entirety of what the map represents.
<br>Mind: comprising the awareness. <a href=real>see more.</a>
<br>Unknown: comprising that which is of the Real and not of Mind.</p>
