<h1>On the Nature of Morality.</h1>
<br>
<p>The Moral is not Real.
<br>Morality is a confusion of desire.
<br>The Real possesses no Moral.</p>
<p>Mind is the origin of Morality, the great delusion.
 Morality is Evil, is Good.
 Morals arise from our sexual nature,
 which perpetuates our species at a cost.
<br>In the year 2019, our destruction draws ever nearer;
 funded by that same sexual nature, our anthropocentric ideal.</p>
<p>Anthropocentrism and every other
<br>Moral are false
<br>and our true sin is in giving creedence to our Morals.</p>
<p>Give no creedence to your own ideas!
<br>A fool does such.</p>
<br>
<p>Know that the Moral is not Real,
 and consists in Belief and Reason.
 Belief tells us what we desire, and Reason how to achieve it.
<br>Belief is the Truth of Mind, not that of the Real.
 Reason is logical extension of Belief.</p>
<p>This is a brief explanation of the Moral.
 Morality is the selfish tool of Mind.</p>
<br>
<p>All this is nothing . . . only wind
<br>The Real is primary
<br>It takes precedence over all
<br>The Real is the Unmoved Mover. It is All;</p>

<p>All is One
<br>This, and all statements of Truth (and only statements of Truth),
 are the only True Morals. All is one.
 What you choose to do is united with all of Reality.
 Consider this when you Act.
<br>The key is a keen awareness of the body, and remembrance of the <a href=true>Truth</a>.</p>
