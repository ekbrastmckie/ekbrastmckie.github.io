<h1>On the Nature of Morality.</h1>
<br>
<p>The Moral is not Real.
<br>Morality is a confusion of desire.
<br>The Real possesses no Moral.</p>
<p>Mind is the origin of Morality, the great delusion.
 Morality is Evil, is Good.
 Morals arise from our sexual nature,
 which perpetuates our species at a cost.
<br>In the year 2019, our destruction draws ever nearer;
 funded by that same sexual nature, our anthropocentric ideal.</p>
<p>Anthropocentrism, as well as all other
<br>morals, is false
<br>and our true sin is in giving creedence to our ideas.</p>
<p>Give no creedence to your ideas!
<br>You would be a fool</p>
<br>
<p>Know that the Moral is not Real,
 and consists in Belief and Reason.
 Belief tells us what we desire, and Reason how to achieve it.
<br>Belief is the Truth of Mind, not that of the Real.
 Reason is logical extension of Belief.</p>
<p>This is a brief explanation of the Moral.
 Morality is the selfish tool of Mind.</p>
<p>All this is nothing . . . only wind
<br>The Real is primary</p>
