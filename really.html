<p>Mass is equivalent to Energy.</p>
<p>The single present moment: always changing. That is real. No past or future. Each one of us is a direct expression of being.</p>
<p>It is due to this truth that, in the present, the future truly <i>could</i> be. It neither will nor will not be. The past, simply, is gone; having metamorphosed and reduced, at last and continually decanting itself into the present.</p>
<p>Do not believe in what is false! Believe in what is true! Truth is always present. </p>

<p>This reality is the philosopher's stone. It is human...</p>
<p>It is greater being than human being. It is <a href="really">Self</a>. It is Reality. It is like the Sun, and like the Earth. It is the true controller.</p>
