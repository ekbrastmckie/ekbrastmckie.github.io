<p>Mass is equivalent to Energy.</p>
<p>The single present moment: always changing. That is real. No past or future. Each one of us is a direct expression of being.</p>
<p>It is due to this truth that fate is and is not. The past is determined. The future is not. In the present, the future truly <i>could</i> be. It neither will nor will not. The past is simply gone.</p>

<p>This reality is the philosopher's stone. It is human... it is greater being than human being. It is Self. It is the Sun. It is the Earth. It is the true controller.</p>
