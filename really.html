<p>Mass is equivalent to Energy.</p>
<p>The single present moment: always changing. That is real. No past or future. Each one of us is a direct expression of being.</p>
<p>It is due to this truth that, in the present, the future truly <i>could</i> be. It neither will nor will not be. The past, simply, is gone; having metamorphosed and reduced, at last and continually decanting itself into the present.</p>
<p>Do not believe in what is false! Believe in what is true! Truth is always present. </p>

<p>This reality is the philosopher's stone. It is human...</p>
<p>It is greater being than human being. It is <a href="really">Self</a>. It is Reality. It is like the Sun. It is like the Earth. It is the true controller.</p>
<br>
<p>The two basic components of human psyche are action and focus</p>
<p>Focus is the locus of awareness</p>
<p>Action is exertion of force, Work</p>
<p>Psyche is a four-dimensional object, continuous and continually in change</p>
<p>nothing of its past remains, in each moment</p>
<p>as it gains and regains</p>
<br>
<p>Focus and Action</p>
<p>Yin and Yang</p>
<p>They are Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>Which is which?</p>
<p>Focus is the Heaven, Sun at its center and brilliantly illuminated by <a href=solar>day</a></p>
<p>darkening at dusk</p>
<p>Action is the Earth, vividly real,sensual, potent to the extreme</p>
<p>not fully known</p>
<p>Heaven and Earth are One</p>
<p>this is Psyche, the soul</p>
<p>It is also the philosopher's stone.</p>
