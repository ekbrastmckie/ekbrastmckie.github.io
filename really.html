<p>Mass is equivalent to Energy.</p>
<p>The single present moment: always changing. That is real. No past or future. Each one of us is a direct expression of being.</p>
<p>It is due to this truth that, in the present, the future truly <i>could</i> be. It neither will nor will not be. The past, simply, is gone; having metamorphosed and reduced, at last and continually decanting itself into the present.</p>
<p>Do not believe in what is false! Believe in what is true! Truth is always present. </p>

<p>This reality is the philosopher's stone. It is human...</p>
<p>It is greater being than human being. It is <a href="really">Self</a>. It is Reality. It is like the Sun. It is like the Earth. It is the true controller.</p>
<br>
<p>The two basic components of human psyche are action and focus</p>
<p>Focus is the locus of awareness</p>
<p>Action is exertion of force, Work</p>
<p>Psyche is a four-dimensional object, continuous and continually in change</p>
<p>nothing of its past remains, in each moment</p>
<p>as it gains and regains</p>
<br>
<p>Focus and Action</p>
<p>Yin and Yang</p>
<p>They are Heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>Which is which?</p>
<p>Focus is the Heaven, Sun at its center and brilliantly illuminated by <a href=solar>day</a></p>
<p>darkening at dusk</p>
<p>Action is the Earth, vividly real,sensual, potent to the extreme</p>
<p>not fully known</p>
<p>Heaven and Earth are One / This is Psyche, the soul / It is also the philosopher's stone.</p>
<p>Focus is Yang, it is daylight and known and can penetrate everything</p>
<p>Action is Yin, it is vast and powerful but in me it is weak and infantile</p>
<p>My cowardly nature has led me to weakness.</p>
<p>Action fills me and surrounds me [cash rules everything around me]</p>
<p>I am its subject and its executor.</p>
<p>Focus is all that I <i>know</i>. It can expand to fill my body.</p>
<p>Fully filled by focus I am pregnant with Power. This is true Control. The mastery of one's action.</p>
<p>Fully aware of action, I know the future. Time begins below, behind. Stay there and you will witness it before it reaches above, in the front.</p>
<p>Stay there and be everywhere else at the same time. Then you can account for everything.</p>
