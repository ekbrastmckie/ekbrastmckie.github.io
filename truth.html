<h1>A Modern Pantheon</h1>
<br>
<p>The Creator creates all things as they are.
 It creates the whole World. It creates the world of Itself;
 the Creator is the Material. It is the World.</p>
<p>Long ago, the Creator made the Earth and it was Good.
 The Good was many who were one. And the Creator made the humans, who were Good.</p>
<p>The Creator made many things, other than the Earth.
 Some of these things were adverse to the Good, and they are called Evils.
The Evils swarmed all around the Good Earth, and did not enter,
 for the Earth was whole, impenetrable. So it was.</p>
<p>First, all of the Humans worshipped the Good Human,
 but soon some of them began to worship the other Goods as well.
 They worshipped the Sun, the Land, the Sea, the Night, and many other Good things.
 As they did so, Human society became complex.</p>
<p>It was then that the people of the Night discovered the first Evil.</p>
<p>The Night is quiet; it is dark.
 The priestains of the Night God knew how to be with the Night, to be like the Night.
 They knew the ways of whispers, and shadows in the dark.
 And whispers they did hear, where only silence should be.
<br>In the dark of the Night Sanctum, the High Priestess saw visions of power, great power.
 That power was the power of Chaos, the power of Creation.
 The Enemy offered her all the power she could want in the world, and she accepted Its guidance.</p>
<p>Thus was born the cult of the Adversary, and so began the rise of Chaos on the Earth.</p>
