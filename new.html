<p>Nothing means anything in particular.
 This is the curse and bless of meaning. Understanding is limited.</p>
<p>Nothing that can be understood is of any substance outside the mind.
 You shouldn't be here if you aren't ready to know these things.</p>
<p>Not to mince words is a great blessing.</p>
<p>Anything I could say to you is of little value. There is value in acts.
 You can choose to act for the good of humanity.
 You can choose to act for the good of the Earth.
 You can choose how you act. Choose well. Act well.</p>
<p>Don't forget what Uncle Hebrew taught you.</p>
<h1>Peace, love, and understanding?</h1>
<p>"What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?"</p>
<p>You know what it means to act for the good of humanity.
 You are prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold that good.
 You are human. The "good of humanity" is wired right into your nervous system.
 You're completely <i>fucked</i> as far as I can see.</p>
<p>...don't worry about that part...</p>
