<h1>The Truth</h1>
<br>
<p>The Truth is that It just doesn't matter.
<br>Nothing really matters; nothing is really important.</p>
<p style:"margin-left=100px"><i>and the Truth about</i> that <i>is
<br>that any deviation in belief from<br>this universal Truth
 is merely self-important <a href=image>delusion</a>.</i></p>
<br>
<p>This is not to suggest that we should value nothing.
 On the contrary, our <a href=moral>Values</a> are what define each of our individual Characters.
<br>John values honesty and integrity.
 Therefore, he determines a human being's Value
 in accordance with his perception of that person's
 honesty and integrity. This determination is applied
<br>equally to himself.
<br>So, John's image of his own Value (self-worth, self-esteem),
and, actually, the entirety of his self-<a href=image>Image</a>
 is based upon his perception of his relationship to his Values.
<br>John's <a href=real>Mind</a> is quite like a map of all his Images.
 So, his Image of himself exists in relation to all of his other Images.</p>
