<h1>The Truth</h1>
<p>is, It just doesn't matter.
<br>Nothing really matters; nothing is really important.</p>
<p style:"margin-left=100px"><i>and the Truth about</i> that <i>is
<br>that any deviation in belief from<br>this universal Truth
 is merely self-important <a href=image>delusion</a>.</i></p>
<br>
<p>This is not to suggest that we should value nothing.
 On the contrary, our <a href=moral>Values</a> are what define our Characters.
<br>John values honesty and integrity.
 Therefore, he determines a human being's Value
 in accordance with his perception of that person's
 honesty and integrity. This determination is applied
<br>equally to himself.
<br>So, John's image of self-Value (or self-worth, self-esteem),
and, actually, the entirety of his <a href=image>Image</a> of himself
 is based upon the relative alignment/variance of <i>his perception of himself</i>
 with his Image of Value.</p>
