<h1>THE NIGHT</h1>
<image src="nightwithmoon.jpg">
<br>
<h2>Welcome to the night.</h2>
<p>Herein, my humble abode lying in shadow, //STOP LYING//
<br>I waken. I am humble!
<br>Herein do I sleep. I am humble!</p>
<p>The night is dark...
<br>In the night we sleep.
<br>Lit by the moon
<br>How could I but wake?
<br>awake, perhaps, too soon.</p>
<p>Rely upon the sun, and night shall be thy undoing.
<br>Rely upon the dark, and the sun shall destroy thee.
<br>Trust in thyself, in thyself</p>
<p>Sleeping the sleep of the damned
<br>I awaken to darkness, and
<br>I thinking my eyes had been blind
<br>proceeded until I did find
<br>the Moon with her shimmering glow
<br>relieved me of fear. Even so,
<br>I shivered and drew myself close.
<br>What was this strange, dim and shady, dark?
<br>What is this sense of foreboding?
<br>Only paranoia? I am afraid of the dark</p>
<br>
<p>Only at night can we see the stars.
 If that isn't worth something, I don't know what is.
<br>Only at night is the moon so lovely that I could swoon.
 Hyperbole, but... well, you get the picture.
<br>The night is cold.
<br>Ah, but in the warm equatorial isles and lowlands,
 night is blessed relief from day's cruel heat.</p>
<p>The night is dark.
<br>Blessed is the dark, which covers up our eyes that we might be made innocent once more.</p>
<p>The night is dark.
<br>Blessed is the dark, which hides us from those who would destroy us.</p>
<p>The night is dark.
<br>Blessed is the dark, blessed the night.
 Protect us from harm, hold us and cleanse us
<br> remove from us our burdens
<br> remove from us our senses</p>
<p>Night is our mother, and sleep is her womb,
<br>from which each morning we emerge.
<br>Sleep is like death, and Night is our tomb,
<br>to which each evening we return.</p>
<br>
<p>Blessed are you, Night,
<br>and may you return ever at the end of Day.</p>
<p>Dawn is your death and dusk your birth, o Night
<br>May it ever be so.</p>
<p>Birth, and Death
<br>Good, and Bad
<br>Day, and Night
<br>Mind, and the Real.
<br> All of these are required, for the sake of balance.
<br>Without Night, Day is an Immortal Oppressor.
<br> Without Day, Night is a Lifeless Winter.
<br>Without Bad, Good leads to rage.
<br> Without Good, Bad leads to despair.
<br>Without Mind, the Real is unknown.
<br> Without the Real, Mind is empty
<br> of meaning,
<br> among other things.</p>
